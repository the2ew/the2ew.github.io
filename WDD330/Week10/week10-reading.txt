Form validation for 3 main reasons:

-Get correct data in correct format

-Protect users' data

-Protect the company

HTML has built-in validation features. Using some CSS, the creator can do something like "input:invalid { box-shadow: red;}" or something else. The invalid selector will proc when the form cannot be submitted due to when the web server or browser dictates that the form doesn't meet the validation requirements.
