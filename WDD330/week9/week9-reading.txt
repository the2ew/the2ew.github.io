localStorage is an HTML5 web storage API.

LocalStorage works in key-value pairs.  localStorage.getItem('key') will display whatever value was stored in the key by doing a localStorage.setItem('key', 'value').

Geolocation API shows location of the user of the website. Permission is given to the user, who can allow or disallow this.

Web workers?

HTML5 makes using multimedia within browsers much easier.

<audio> and <video> are used to display audio and video respectively. The src attribute is also used within those tags to locate your video or audio file.
