   <h2>Design Principles</h2>
   <!-- ***********************************************
Each design principle needs three items:
1- The principle's name and the team member responsible for it.
2- An image (screenshot) of the mobile browser screen showing the design principle in use.
3- A discussion of how the design principle is exemplified in the picture. Be detailed but keep it to one paragraph!

   <h3>Contrast &mdash; Chandler Tew</h3>

   <p>
    Here Fandango uses contrast as seen in orange. The logo up at the nav bar is orange, making it stand out. Also, the call to action buttons and links are all in orange, helping the user to identify points of interest. This guides them in making descions faster, because they know where to go and it also helps the owner of the site accomplish his purpose.

   <h3>Typography &mdash; Ryan Call</h3>
   <img src="" alt="Screen shot illustrating typography in use">
   <p>
    In this screenshot there are several forms of typography, be it in the size, style, kerning, and tracking of its text. To start off with the title of the movie “Guardians of the galaxy vol. 2,”  is in all uppercase and spaced out invoking its importance. It is the first thing you see and your eyes are drawn to it first, then with its alignment to the left side the text continues to pull your eyes down. You see the rating and time in duller and smaller text and the page continues to flow smoothly with a location, times and other location options. Its new sections have bold words to bring your attention to them while not drawing too much focus away from the main title. These are the examples of typography shown in this screenshot
